# Anything Throws Project
 This is the development repository for Anything Throws, a low-poly exploration game in which the player must search the environment for objects they can place into a trebuchet and launch. The more objects thrown, the closer the play is to throwing enough to knock down the big wall ahead of them.
 
Control Schemes:
  - WASD Keyboard movement with mouse-following camera, F to interact with object 
  - Controller Scheme is currently in development
